    <h2>Proposition: Police misconduct is not actually a relevant problem in this day and age, as most police violations are found to be false or unsubstantiated.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					Across all complaint types, most result in the officer being exonerated or the CCRB finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose to group together the exonerated and unsubstantiated categories. This helped make the proportion larger in comparison to the substantiated categories. (Rating: -2)
				</li>
				<li>I kept the substantiated categories mostly separate in order to break them up and make them smaller in comparison to the exonerated and unsubstantiated category. I considered keeping them completely separate, but the legend having even more “substantiated” categories emphasized how prevalent it was. (Rating: -1)
				</li>
				<li>I showed all four categories of complaints to demonstrate the consistency of the trends across them all. I also made their size dependent on their overall prevalence in order to emphasize that they weren’t all significant problems. This also helped emphasize the dominance of the exonerated and unsubstantiated category in the smaller charts, where it was more difficult to see the other categories. (Rating: 1)
				</li>
				<li>I counted the number of individual complaints rather than distinct officers. This raised the proportion of the exonerated and unsubstantiated category and made the trend more exaggerated. (Rating: -1)
				</li>
				<li>I chose to use a bright orange for the exonerated and unsubstantiated category and muted colors for the rest of the categories in order to emphasize the dominant category. I also tried making the dominant category green in order to emphasize that it was the “good” option, but I felt that the orange more effectively catches viewers’ attention. (Rating: 1)

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					Substantiated claims have increased significantly over the past 20 years.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose to show the trend over time starting all the way back from 1985. This emphasized the overall increase and the difference in magnitude between the officer numbers from then and recent years. (Rating: 1)
				</li>
				<li>I excluded all the data points for both 2019 and 2020 because they showed a sharp decrease in the number of officers, which detracted from the narrative that I was trying to build about the numbers increasing. However, the drop in the Abuse of Authority numbers still was noticeable. (Rating: -2)
				</li>
				<li>I chose to count the number of distinct officers who had complaints filed against them rather than the number of individual complaints because the increasing trend was clearer. (Rating: -1)
				</li>
				<li>I used distinct lines instead of areas under the curve in order to emphasize that each category was distinctly increasing. This was a bit of a tradeoff because the areas helped emphasize the overall magnitude of the number of officers, but gave the impression that the numbers were dependent on each other rather than distinct. (Rating: 1)
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Overall, I enjoyed exploring different ways to convey wildly opposing conclusions using the same set of data. I found it a bit challenging to choose different visualization formats  (pie chart, line graph, etc.) that would help me best craft my supporting and opposing arguments. On the other hand, I found it easy to exclude particular data points and group categories together in order to emphasize the trends that I was seeking to convey. I was surprised that I was able to easily make up justifications to myself for some of these more deceptive design decisions.

		After completing this assignment, I now have a more nuanced understanding of what an “ethical” visualization entails. I think that in order for a visualization to be ethical, the intentions during the design process are highly influential, and any changes, data transformations, and design decisions need to be clearly communicated and/or explained. However, while some design decisions can be firmly deceptive (like excluding data without mentioning it) and some can be earnest (like redundant encoding), I think it’s difficult to draw a clear line between ethical and unethical for an overall visualization because all design decisions are informed and influenced by our personal perspectives and biases. Instead, I think it’s crucial to focus on being transparent and communicating choices and the intentions behind them to the viewer, and letting them draw their own conclusions.
